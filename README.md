## 📂 Repository Name
**superstore-sales-analysis**

## ✏️ Short Description
Data analysis and sales prediction on Sample Superstore dataset using Python, Pandas, and Linear Regression.

---

## 📁 Dataset
- **Source:** SampleSuperstore_Simplified.csv
- **Columns:** Order Date, Region, Segment, Category, Sub-Category, Quantity, Discount, Sales, Profit, Ship Mode

---

## 🔍 Objective
To analyze business trends in sales and profit, and build a basic machine learning model to predict sales based on Quantity and Discount.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Sales and profit by Category and Sub-Category
- Monthly sales trend
- Shipping Mode usage distribution
- Discount impact on Sales
- Correlation heatmap

---

## 🤖 Model Building
- **Model:** Linear Regression
- **Features:** Quantity, Discount
- **Target:** Sales
- **Evaluation Metrics:** R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE)

---

## 📈 Results & Insights
- Technology and Office Supplies were the most profitable categories.
- Discounts above 20% did not always increase sales.
- "Standard Class" was the most frequently used shipping method.
- A weak negative correlation was found between discount and profit.

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Hands-on experience with data cleaning and visualization.
- Gained understanding of basic regression modeling.
- Improved data storytelling using graphs and summaries.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Include categorical features like Region and Sub-Category in model
- Try ensemble models like Random Forest or XGBoost
- Deploy this project using Streamlit for better interactivity
